<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

🚀 My name is Robert, I'm 14 years old and live in 🇬🇧 England. I'm a self-taught full stack developer specialising in TypeScript, C++ and many others. I also own the [Official TypeScript Community](https://discord.gg/typescript).

✉️ **Contact**: You can find me on Discord as `robert#0003`, or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robertwestburyz) (although I'm not very active). For important stuff my personal email is `robertrwestbury@gmail.com`.

🚧 **Projects**: I have previously worked on [Typus](https://github.com/typusio), [Chapter](https://github.com/freecodecamp/chapter), and many others. I am currently working on [Blue](https://github.com/tryblue), along with many other exciting projects!

🥞 **Stack**: I primarily use TypeScript, Postgres, React (sometimes Next), Node, and Docker. I have worked with many other stacks and it is always evolving!
